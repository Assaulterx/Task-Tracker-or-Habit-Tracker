Task Tracker / Habit Tracker
A minimal, browser-based task and habit tracker that lets you manage tasks, tick off daily progress, and visualize your consistency over time using charts and streaks.
​

Features
Task management – Add, complete, and delete tasks with a clean card-style UI and filters for All, Active, and Completed.
​

Daily habit tracking – Per-task daily checkboxes from the goal start date to today, with only today’s box interactive to keep history clean.
​

Goal system – Configure goal duration (days) and tasks-per-day, with automatic streak calculation, days remaining, and progress percentages.
​

Analytics dashboard – Total/Completed tasks, completion rate, tasks with notes, bar chart of tasks completed per day, and a doughnut chart of completed vs pending.
​

Task-specific insights – Per-task panel showing created/completed date, days to complete, note count, status, and notes history.
​

Local personalization – Editable dashboard name, time-based greeting, and live clock; all data stored in localStorage so it works fully offline after first load.
